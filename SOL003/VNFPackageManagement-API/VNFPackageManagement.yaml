    IMPORTANT: Please note that this file might be not aligned to the current

    In clause 4.3.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 v2.4.1, an attribute-based filtering
    mechanism is defined. This mechanism is currently not included in the
    corresponding OpenAPI design for this GS version. Changes to the
    attribute-based filtering mechanism are being considered in v2.5.1 of this
    GS for inclusion in the corresponding future ETSI NFV OpenAPI design.

              IETF RFC 7807 [19] is reproduced inthis structure. Compared to the
              general framework defined in IETF RFC 7807 [19], the "status" and
              "detail" attributes are mandated to be included by the present
              document, to ensure that the response contains additional textual
              information about an error. IETF RFC 7807 [19] foresees
              extensibility of the "ProblemDetails" type. It is possible that
              particular APIs in the present document, or particular
              implementations, define extensions to define additional attributes
              that provide more information about the error. The description
              column only provides some explanation of the meaning to Facilitate
              understanding of the design. For a full description, see IETF RFC
              7807 [19].

        The POST method creates a new subscription. Creation of two subscription
        resources with the same callbackURI and the same filter can result in
        performance degradation and will provide duplicates of notifications to
        the VNFM, and might make sense only in very rare use cases.
        Consequently, the NFVO may either allow creating a subscription resource
        if another subscription resource with the same filter and callbackUri
        already exists (in which case it shall return the â€œ201 Createdâ€ response
        code), or may decide to not create a duplicate subscription resource (in
        which case it shall return a â€œ303 See Otherâ€ response code referencing
        the existing subscription resource with the same filter and
        callbackUri).
