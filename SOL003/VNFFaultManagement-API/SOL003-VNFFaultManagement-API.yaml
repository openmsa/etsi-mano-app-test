    SOL003 - VNF Fault Management interface


    IMPORTANT: Please note that this file might be not aligned to the current
    version of the ETSI Group Specification it refers to. In case of
    discrepancies the published ETSI Group Specification takes precedence.


    In clause 4.3.2 of ETSI GS NFV-SOL 003 v2.4.1, an attribute-based filtering
    mechanism is defined. This mechanism is currently not included in the
    corresponding OpenAPI design for this GS version. Changes to the
    attribute-based filtering mechanism are being considered in v2.5.1 of this
    GS for inclusion in the corresponding future ETSI NFV OpenAPI design.

        The POST method creates a new subscription. Creation of two subscription
        resources with the same callbackURI and the same filter can result in
        performance degradation and will provide duplicates of notifications to
        the NFVO, and might make sense only in very rare use cases.
        Consequently, the VNFM may either allow creating a subscription resource
        if another subscription resource with the same filter and callbackUri
        already exists (in which case it shall return the “201 Created” response
        code), or may decide to not create a duplicate subscription resource (in
        which case it shall return a “303 See Other” response code referencing
        the existing subscription resource with the same filter and
        callbackUri).

            Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe

            necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from

                Indicates the relative level of urgency for operator attention.

                  affecting condition has occurred and an immediate corrective action
                  is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when a
                  managed object becomes totally out of service and its capability needs
                  to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).

                affecting
                  condition has developed and an urgent corrective action is required.
                  Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe
                  degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full
                  capability needs to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                * MINOR: The Minor severity level indicates the existence of a
                  non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action
                  should be taken in order to prevent a more serious (for example,
                  service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for
                  example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading
                  the capacity of the managed object (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).

                  potential or impending service affecting fault, before any significant
                  effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if
                  necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from
                  becoming a more serious service affecting fault (ITU-T Recommendation

                  severity level cannot be determined (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                * CLEARED: The Cleared severity level indicates the clearing of

                  more previously reported alarms. This alarm clears all alarms for this
                  managed object that have the same Alarm type, Probable cause and

                Indicates the relative level of urgency for operator attention.
                * CRITICAL: The Critical severity level indicates that a service
                  affecting condition has occurred and an immediate corrective action
                  is required. Such a severity can be reported, for example, when a
                  managed object becomes totally out of service and its capability needs
                  to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                * MAJOR: The Major severity level indicates that a service
                affecting
                  condition has developed and an urgent corrective action is required.
                  Such a severity can be reported, for example, when there is a severe
                  degradation in the capability of the managed object and its full
                  capability needs to be restored (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                * MINOR: The Minor severity level indicates the existence of a
                  non-service affecting fault condition and that corrective action
                  should be taken in order to prevent a more serious (for example,
                  service affecting) fault. Such a severity can be reported, for
                  example, when the detected alarm condition is not currently degrading
                  the capacity of the managed object (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                * WARNING: The Warning severity level indicates the detection of
                a
                  potential or impending service affecting fault, before any significant
                  effects have been felt. Action should be taken to further diagnose (if
                  necessary) and correct the problem in order to prevent it from
                  becoming a more serious service affecting fault (ITU-T Recommendation
                  X.733).
                * INDETERMINATE: The Indeterminate severity level indicates that
                the
                  severity level cannot be determined (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
                * CLEARED: The Cleared severity level indicates the clearing of
                one or
                  more previously reported alarms. This alarm clears all alarms for this
                  managed object that have the same Alarm type, Probable cause and
                  Specific problems (if given) (ITU-T Recommendation X.733).
