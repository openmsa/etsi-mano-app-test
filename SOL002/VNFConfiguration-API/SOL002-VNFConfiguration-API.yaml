            Bad Request

            If the request is malformed or syntactically incorrect (e.g. if the
            request URI contains incorrect query parameters or a syntactically
            incorrect payload body), the API producer shall respond with this
            response code. The "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and
            should include in the "detail" attribute more information about the
            source of the problem.

             ---

            If the request contains a malformed access token, the API producer
            should respond with this response. The details of the error shall be
            returned in the WWW-Authenticate HTTP header, as defined in IETF RFC
            6750 and IETF RFC 7235. The ProblemDetails structure may be
            provided.

             ---

            If there is an application error related to the client's input that
            cannot be easily mapped to any other HTTP response code ("catch all
            error"), the API producer shall respond with this response code.The
            "ProblemDetails" structure shall be provided, and shall include in
            the "detail" attribute more information about the source of the
            problem.

        description: >
          Modifications to configuration data for certain VNFC instances. See
          NOTE 1 and NOTE 2. If present, the modifications of the
          "vnfcConfigurationData" attribute shall follow these  provisions:
            Modifying an attribute that is an array of objects of type "VnfcConfigurationData".
              Assumptions:
                  1) "oldList" is the "VnfcConfigurationData" array to be modified and "newList"
                     is the "VnfcConfigurationData" array that contains the changes.
                  2) "oldEntry" is an entry in "oldList" and "newEntry" is an entry in "newList".
                  3) A "newEntry" has a "corresponding entry" if there exists an "oldEntry" that 
                     has the same content of the "vnfcInstanceId" attribute as the "newEntry"; 
                     a "newEntry" has no corresponding entry if no such "oldEntry" exists.
                  4) In any array of "VnfcConfigurationData" structures, the content of "vnfcInstanceId"
                     is unique (i.e. there shall be no two entries with the same content of "vnfcInstanceId").
              Provisions:
                  1) For each "newEntry" in "newList" that has no corresponding entry in "oldList", 
                     the "oldList" array shall be modified by adding that "newEntry".

                  2) For each "newEntry" in "newList" that has a corresponding "oldEntry" in "oldList",
                     the value of "oldEntry" shall be updated with the value of "newEntry" according to
                    the rules of JSON Merge PATCH (see IETF RFC 7396 ).
