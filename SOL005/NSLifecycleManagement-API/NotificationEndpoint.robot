NS LCM Operation Occurrence Start Notification
    [Documentation]    Test ID: 5.3.2.17.1
    ...    Test title: NS LCM Operation Occurrence Start Notification
    ...    Test objective: The objective is to test the dispatch of NS LCM Operation Occurrence Start Notification when a new NS LCM operation is started in the NFVO, and perform a JSON schema and content validation of the delivered notification. The action that triggers the notification under test is an explicit test step, but it is not performed by the test system.
    ...    Pre-conditions: A subscription for NS LCM Operation Occurrence notifications is available in the NFVO.
    ...    Reference: clause 6.4.18.3.1 - SOL005 v2.4.1
    ...    Config ID: Config_prod_NFVO
    ...    Applicability: none
    ...    Post-Conditions: none

NS LCM Operation Occurrence Result Notification
    [Documentation]    Test ID: 5.3.2.17.2
    ...    Test title: NS LCM Operation Occurrence Result Notification
    ...    Test objective: The objective is to test the dispatch of NS LCM Operation Occurrence Result Notification when a NS LCM operation is completed in the NFVO, and perform a JSON schema and content validation of the delivered notification.

NS Identifier Deletion Notification
    [Documentation]    Test ID: 5.3.2.17.4
    ...    Test title: NS Identifier Deletion Notification
    ...    Test objective: The objective is to test the dispatch of NS Identifier Deletion Notification when a NS instance resource is deleted in the NFVO, and perform a JSON schema and content validation of the delivered notification.The action that triggers the notification under test is an explicit test step, but it is not performed by the test system.
