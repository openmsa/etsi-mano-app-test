# NFV API Conformance Test Specification

This repository hosts the NFV API Conformance test specification for 
the APIs defined in ETSI NFV GS [SOL002](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SOL/001_099/002/02.04.01_60/gs_NFV-SOL002v020401p.pdf), [SOL003](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SOL/001_099/003/02.04.01_60/gs_NFV-SOL003v020401p.pdf), [SOL005](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/NFV-SOL/001_099/005/02.04.01_60/gs_NFV-SOL005v020401p.pdf), in their versions v2.4.1.

## Disclaimer

This repository contains working test cases implemented using the Robot 
framework. It is provided for information only and is still under development. 
The test cases may be updated, deleted, replaced, or obsoleted by other 
contents at any time. As test cases are approved, they will be reflected 
in the normative provisions of 
[GS NFV-TST010](https://docbox.etsi.org/isg/nfv/open/Drafts/TST010_API_Conformance_Testing).

The material in this repository does not guarantee the full compliance 
to the SOL specifications. The normative provisions of the test suite, 
including the scope of the test cases, are still under development. 


## Overview

The Test Specification is built as a collection of [Robot Framework](robotframework.org/) Test Description. [Robot Framework](robotframework.org/) is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development.

**IMPORTANT: This repository and the NFV API Conformance Test Specification is Work in Progress. The current version focuses on conformance tests of individual SOL002 and SOL003 resource endpoints. The [Robot Framework](robotframework.org/) Test Descriptions are expected to be consolidated and reviewed in the short term, and possibly re-organized to ease automation of NFV workflows testing. SOL005 Test Descriptions are under development and will be contributed during Q1-2019.**
